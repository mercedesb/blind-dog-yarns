     I have always felt that handmade gifts mean so much more than store-bought ones. As a child, I would plan for months to
    make sure that my family and friends all received the "perfect" gift. I spent hours creating whether with yarn, fabric, glass,
    photos, paint--you name it, I've probably tried crafting with it.

    I always return to yarn as my chosen medium. And I find
    working with my hands, whether it be crochet or spinning, relaxing yet challenging and such a welcome change of pace from
    software development (my day job).

    The handspun yarn you see featured in some of the items in my shop is hand spun by me, and
    in many cases is hand dyed by me as well. I hand paint my wool using environmentally friendly, heavy metal free acid dyes.
    The dyes I use comply with the Organic Trade Association's criteria for organic processing.

    The shop name, Blind Dog Yarns, is inspired by my late dog, George, a blind Australian Cattle Dog and his crazy antics. I'm always telling stories about George
    to whoever will listen and I couldn't resist a good pun :)
