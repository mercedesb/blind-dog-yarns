This past Saturday was Our Maker Life 2018 in the West Loop in Chicago. Our Maker Life is a conference put on for makers by makers. It is a chance to connect with others who share your passions and won’t look at you weirdly when you find yourself talking about yarn for the better part of 30 minutes. 

I will fully admit that I had bought my OML ticket months ago on a whim without really knowing what the event was or what to expect. I wish I could say I was excited for the key notes and that I had been following along with everyone as they got ready and traveled to the city for the event, but I can’t because I had no idea who any one was. I do the bare minimum on the ‘gram. Despite working in software, sharing my life on social media makes me uncomfortable. Although I’m passionate about my craft, I tend to do all of my making within a small bubble of one, just me by myself. I had no idea that there was this big beautiful web of makers who had never met each other yet were so connected and supportive. 

The whole day felt like a giant hug. Cheesy I know, but its true. Everyone was so welcoming. No one was afraid to admit that they were stepping outside their comfort zone by attending and meeting so many new people at once. It was refreshing to be around people who, like me, tend to stay away from large groups but are so passionate about fiber arts that they couldn’t resist coming together and sharing that passion with so many friendly strangers.

Brittany of B. Hooked Crochet opened the event with a key note of ideas on how to leave behind your fear and start your maker business. There were so many juicy tidbits and Brittany is so well spoken, I couldn’t help but take notes with things I wanted to remember to do as I prepare to give a talk at a software development conference next month. One item that Brittany said that stuck with me was to find a problem and just go solve it. It seems so simple, but I really needed someone to say it out loud for me to realize that there isn’t anything holding me back from trying new things and solving new problems.

After Brittany, Jessica of The Hook Nook gave her keynote. She shared so much of herself with us, and her vulnerability and determination was nothing short of inspiring. Instagram has us viewing each other through filters and Jessica threw aside those filters in front of a room full of people to show what its really like and what it really takes to achieve your dreams.  I’m sure it wasn’t easy to get up and do that, but I needed it and I appreciate it. 

The rest of the day was filled with networking and mingling, a panel discussion, and a knit/crochet along. I met so many wonderful people and was able to talk about yarn all day. I was in heaven! I’ve been struggling to stay motivated with my crafting recently and have been so bogged down and stressed with work and other responsibilities that my main stress relief has taken a back seat. OML was exactly what I needed to recharge my batteries and jump back into making. I’m so grateful for this event and to all the people I met and shared the experience with. I can’t wait for OML 2019.
