  <h2>Ready to ship art yarn scarves</h2>
  <p>
    These one of a kind cowls and scarves are made with a combination of commercial acrylic yarn and hand spun wool art yarn. The art yarn was hand dyed, blended, and spun by me and adds such
    a fun, funky touch to the common scarf. These cowls and scarves are lightweight and would be great in fall or spring or to complete your
    winter outfit.
