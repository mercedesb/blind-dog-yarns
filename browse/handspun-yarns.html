  <h2>Made to order handspun yarn</h2>
  <p>
    I spin my yarn on my Schact Ladybug spinning wheel in a smoke-free, dog friendly home. 
    My yarns are not washed with traditional detergent, but are given a soak in Eucalan Delicate Wash.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases, the fiber is hand dyed by me as well. I hand paint my wool using environmentally friendly, heavy metal free acid dyes.
    The dyes I use comply with the Organic Trade Association's criteria for organic processing.
    I prefer to dye my wool prior to spinning so that I have more freedom to play with color during spinning and plying.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Pricing</h3>
  <p>
    Pricing is based on yardage and weight, as well as the type of fiber base and whether or not I have hand dyed it myself. Specialty fibers such as alpaca or
    hard to find wool breeds may cost more.
  </p>
  <p>
    For non-specialty fibers that I have hand dyed, pricing is $3.75/oz of fiber and .10/yd of yarn spun <br/> 
    
    e.g. 4oz spun to 250 yds (roughly DK weight) will be $40
