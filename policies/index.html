<h2>Care instructions</h2>

<p>Acrylic yarn does not felt and holds up well to washing and drying. Please wash on the gentle cycle and tumble dry low.</p>
<p>My handspun yarn is wool and will felt. For all items featuring my handspun yarn, hand washing and laying flat to dry is recommended.</p>

<h2>Tell me about your wool</h2>

<p>The majority of the wool featured in my cowls and scarves is a fine Merino wool. Most of it is also hand dyed by me using environmentally friendly, low impact dyes. These dyes are heavy metal free which keeps toxic metals from entering the environment, particularly groundwater, throughout the life cycle of the dye and wool.</p>
